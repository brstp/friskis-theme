Wordpress theme for Friskis&Svettis
Originally developed by the web agency Strop or a group och Friskis&Svettis clubs in the Stockholm region. Maintained by stefan.pettersson@lumano.se, +46 733 12 55 55.

Apart from the theme there are some nice to have files in the jumpstart directory.

Installation:

Install the theme zip file.

Create a start page. I assume it's called "Start"

Settings:

General > Site Title: The name of the club.
General > Tagline: #empty
Reading > Front page displays: A static page: "Start"

Media > Thumbnail size: 260x135, crop
Media > Medium size: 196x0
Media > Large size: 460x0

Permalinks > Post name

Friskis&Svettis > Förening (Club): The name of the club
Friskis&Svettis > Facebook-konto (Facebook account): Part of the url to a facebook page, everything after the domain name, excluding the initial slash.
Friskis&Svettis > Facebook-konto (Twitter account): The twitter handle (without "@").


On the page "Start" the slider and three teasers are published by editors. Use exact image sizes. Sample files are available in the jumpstart directory. Always use one or more sliders and exactly three teasers. Use the "Add row" buttons to add more slider images or teasers.

Translations on the start page: 

Bildspel: Slider
Bildstorlek: Image size
Bild: Image
Sidlänk: Page to link to
Alt: Alt tag for the image
Puffar: Teasers
Rubrik: Header


Copy favicon.ico to web server root.

The main menu must be named "Primär navigation".
Tha footer menu must me named "Sidfotsmeny".
(Yes. It's ugly.)
